# Blind-50

A collection of solutions to a curated list of best practice LeetCode questions, geared towards Swift developers.

This list follows the same structure as [Tech Interview Handbook - Best Practice Questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/).

## Intention

iOS developers oftentimes wish to skip over data structures and algorithms; though valid to some degree (in terms of actual on-the-job activities), data structures and algorithms, even if used in the context of "trivia" style questions like LeetCode, are still fundamental to computer science and should be studied. 

Hopefully, this list can be of help to others diving into the topic.
